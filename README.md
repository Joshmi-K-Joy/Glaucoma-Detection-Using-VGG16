# üëÅÔ∏è Glaucoma Detection Using VGG16

## üìò Overview

This project, **Glaucoma Detection Using VGG16**, was developed as part of the final semester **major project** in the B.Tech program (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) at **Srinivas University Institute of Engineering and Technology**.

The aim is to aid in the **early detection of glaucoma**, a serious and often undiagnosed eye disease, by leveraging **deep learning** and **transfer learning**. The model uses the **VGG16 convolutional neural network** to classify **retinal fundus images** as **glaucomatous** or **non-glaucomatous**.

## üß† Problem Statement

Glaucoma is a silent thief of vision that damages the optic nerve irreversibly. Due to its gradual onset, early diagnosis is often missed. This project builds an **AI-assisted tool** to support ophthalmologists in **automated glaucoma screening** using retinal images.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

1. **Limited and Imbalanced Dataset**
   - Medical datasets were small and had fewer glaucoma-positive samples.
   - Solution: Data augmentation and class weighting were applied.

2. **Overfitting**
   - The model initially overfit due to a small dataset.
   - Solution: Used Dropout, regularization, and early stopping.

3. **Image Quality Variance**
   - Fundus images varied in resolution and lighting.
   - Solution: Preprocessing with OpenCV and normalization helped standardize inputs.

4. **Model Tuning**
   - VGG16 has many layers; tuning without overfitting was challenging.
   - Solution: Froze base layers and experimented with custom dense layers.

5. **Understanding Medical Context**
   - Needed to understand glaucoma symptoms and visual cues.
   - Solution: Collaborated with medical professionals and studied medical papers.
